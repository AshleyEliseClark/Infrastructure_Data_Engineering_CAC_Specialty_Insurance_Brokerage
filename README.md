# CAC Specialty – Data Infrastructure & Analytics Simulation

## Objective

Demonstrate insurance data engineering workflows based on real-world experience (2019–2021), simulating how AWS, SQL, and Power BI were used to integrate data and deliver insights.

## Use Cases

- Ingest structured data (Salesforce CRM, claims, policies, spreadsheets) into AWS S3.
- Build SQL-based staging, fact, and dimension tables for standardized reporting.
- Create Power BI dashboards for broker performance, client retention, and claims analysis.
- Deliver reproducible insights through optimized queries and documentation.

## Tech Stack (2019–2021)

- **AWS S3** → raw data storage
- **SQL (PostgreSQL / SQL Server)** → transformation & reporting
- **Salesforce CRM** → client + broker source data
- **Power BI / Excel** → dashboards & reporting
